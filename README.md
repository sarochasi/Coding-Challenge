## Task 1: Responsive Webpage

### Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a responsive, multi-section webpage with modern design principles. It includes a header, navigation bar, main content section, and footer. Each section is fully responsive and designed to provide a clean user experience. A dark mode toggle is also implemented to enhance accessibility.

### Features

* Responsive Layout:
  * Utilized Flexbox to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness.
  * Designed sections to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
* Multi-Section Navigation:
  * A navigation bar links to three sections: About, Projects, and Contact.
  * The navigation bar is centered and highlights the active section.
* Dark Mode Toggle:
  * Users can switch between light and dark themes with a button.
  * The toggle updates colors dynamically for all elements, including the header, main content, and footer.

### Libraries or Frameworks Used

* HTML: Structured the webpage using semantic HTML5 elements for better readability and maintainability.
* CSS: No external libraries; used native CSS with Flexbox for responsiveness.
* JavaScript: Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic interactions (e.g., section visibility, dark mode toggle).
* Google Fonts: Used Inter and Roboto for a modern typographic style.
